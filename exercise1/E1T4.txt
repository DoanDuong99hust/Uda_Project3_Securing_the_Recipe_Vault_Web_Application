Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data 
and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices 
as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
VPC security group rules should not permit ingress from '0.0.0.0/0' to TCP/UDP port 22 (SSH)

# Poor practice 2
S3 bucket server side encryption should be enabled

# Poor practice 3
S3 buckets should have all `block public access` options enabled

# Poor practice 4
S3 bucket policies should only allow requests that use HTTPS

# Poor practice 5
IAM role shouldn't have permission as admin with s3
